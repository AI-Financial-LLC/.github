### How to follow the workflow

We'll follow a GitFlow branching strategy.
```
# production branch
- main

# features branch
- feature/what_have_you_been_working_on_?

```

### Main Branch
Here, we have the source code running on the server. This means that the code here will be the one that anyone can see. We're ready to connect with potential clients :)

`
Please make sure to test what you've done before merging it into the main branch!!!
`

### Feature Branch
Here, we have our latest releases where we test out various features and cool things!

`
All code is meant to be developed in this branch. After testing it out, it can be merged into the main branch.
`

### Merge Process
Finally, we need to merge our latest code, which has been tested and is in working order, into the production or main branch. So, you should open a pull request, and someone from the team will review it. If everything looks good, hopefully, it will be approved.

`
Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, the CI/CD workflow will automatically start uploading the latest code to the server (production).
